Use this guide to file a clear report so we can reproduce and fix the bug quickly. Screenshots, short screen recordings, and relevant logs or files speed up diagnosis.

## Bug report template

**Title:** Be specific, e.g., `Bug: media upload stalls at 95%`.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Step one (include exact clicks/taps, inputs, or shortcuts).
2. Step two.
3. Step three (note timing or ordering details).

**Expected result:** What you expected to happen.

**Actual result:** What happened instead (include exact errors or on-screen messages).

**System and client settings:** In User Settings, tap your client info at the bottom of the sidebar to copy it, then paste it here.

## Add evidence

Include anything that shows the issue—screenshots, short videos, logs, or sample files/exports. More detail means faster help.

## Submit your report

Email support@fluxer.app with the filled template. A concise subject, such as `Bug report: media upload stuck`, helps us triage faster. Prefer GitHub? File issues in the [Fluxer GitHub repository](https://github.com/fluxerapp/fluxer); use the correct template and check for existing reports first. High-quality, non-duplicate reports we approve—whether emailed or filed on GitHub—may earn an invite to our private Fluxer Testers community, where you can unlock the Bug Hunter badge.

## Security issues

If you believe the issue is security-related, visit our [Security Bug Bounty page](/security) instead of emailing Support. Follow the guidance there, include clear steps, why you think it is a security risk, and any impact you see. We respond quickly to assess, coordinate a fix, and discuss disclosure expectations.
